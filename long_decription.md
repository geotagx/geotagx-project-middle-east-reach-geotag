<p>This module is for geotagging photos for the emergency shelter assessment in the Middle East.</p>

 <p>These photos come from refugee camps it Iraq and Jordan. If you don't know exactly where it is you can circle the whole country, that is still valuable.
</p>
<p>Click on "View Source" to see where the photo came from, the information on the source should tell you what country the photo was taken in</p>
<p>If you have the name of the camp in which the photo was taken, try searching for it on Google, this might help narrow down where it is</p>
<p>If it is not possible to geotag the photo, don't worry! Just click ‘don't know’ then save your answer, it is still valid and useful.
