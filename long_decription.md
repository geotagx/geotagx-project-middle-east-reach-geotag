This module is for geotagging photos for the emergency shelter assessment in the Middle East.

These photos come from refugee camps in Iraq and Jordan. If you don't know exactly where the photo was taken, you can select the whole country, that is still valuable.

Check out the photo's source to see where it came from, the information on the source should tell you what country the photo was taken in.

If you have the name of the camp in which the photo was taken, try searching for it on Google, this might help narrow down its location.

If it is not possible to geotag the photo, don't worry! Just click **I DON'T KNOW** as it is still a valid and useful answer.
